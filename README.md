# Analytic-Vidhya-Competition
This repository contains the code for my participation in a sales prediction competition. It was a significant milestone in my AI-ML learning journey, where I had the opportunity to apply various regression methods to forecast the sales of different products at specific outlets.
# Competition Objective
The primary objective of the competition was to build a predictive model that accurately forecasts the sales of each product at different outlets. The model's performance was evaluated based on scoring metrics provided by the competition platform, which quantified its prediction accuracy.
# Regression Methods
I employed various regression methods in my code, including:
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Ensemble techniques
After extensive experimentation and evaluation, the Decision Tree algorithm emerged as the best performer, producing the highest prediction score among the models tested. The scoring metrics used were provided by the competition platform and automatically shown in the submission section of the site.
# Competition Results
Despite being in the early stages of my AI-ML learning, I achieved a respectable rank of 8247 out of 49432 registered participants. This competition allowed me to demonstrate my ability to apply different regression techniques, analyze their results, and optimize predictions for real-world scenarios.
# Conclusion
Participating in this sales prediction competition was an invaluable learning experience. It showcased my growth and enthusiasm in the AI-ML field, emphasizing my ability to handle real-world data, implement regression methods, and optimize predictions. I'm proud of the progress I made and the results I achieved during this competition.
