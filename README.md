This repository contains the code for my participation in a sales prediction competition. It was a significant milestone in my AI-ML learning journey, where I had the opportunity to apply various regression methods to forecast the sales of different products at specific outlets.
# Competition Objective
The primary objective of the competition was to build a predictive model that accurately forecasts the sales of each product at different outlets. The model's performance was evaluated based on scoring metrics provided by the competition platform, which quantified its prediction accuracy.
